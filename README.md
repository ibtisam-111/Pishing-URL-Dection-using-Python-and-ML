Phishing is a form of fraudulent attack where the attacker tries to gain sensitive information by posing as a reputable source. In a typical phishing attack, a victim opens a compromised link that poses as a credible website. The victim is then asked to enter their credentials, but since it is a “fake” website, the sensitive information is routed to the hacker and the victim gets ”‘hacked.”

Phishing is popular since it is a low effort, high reward attack. Most modern web browsers, antivirus software and email clients are pretty good at detecting phishing websites at the source, helping to prevent attacks. To understand how they work, this repo  will you how to build your own phishing URL detector using Python and machine learning:

Identify the criteria that can recognize fake URLs
Build a decision tree that can iterate through the criteria
Train our model to recognize fake vs real URLs
Evaluate our model to see how it performs
Check for false positives/negatives
